## 1. Introduction
The WebpayConnection and WebpayAdmin classes make up the Svea API. Together they provide unified entrypoints to the various Svea web services. The API also encompass the support classes IConfigurationProvider, SveaResponse and Item, as well as various constant container classes and support classes.

The WebpayConnection class methods contains the functions needed to create orders and perform payment requests using Svea payment methods. It contains methods to define order contents, send order requests, as well as support methods needed to do this.

The WebPayAdmin class methods are used to administrate orders after they have been accepted by Svea. It includes functions to update, deliver, cancel and credit orders et.al. Note! This entrypoint is under construction and all functions not yet implemented.

## 2. Build and Configuration

To build the dll file, load up the project in Visual studio.
Choose 'Release' as your solution configuration and press F6.
(The solution is compatible and will compile properly with .NET Framework 4.0 and higher.)

This will build the dll and place it in bin/release sub-folder of the project.

[<< To top](https://github.com/sveawebpay/dotnet-integration/tree/master#cnet-integration-package-api-for-sveawebpay)

The Configuration needed to be set differs of how many different payment methods and countries you have in the same installation.
The authorization values are recieved from Svea Ekonomi when creating an account. If no configuration is created, use SveaConfig.GetDefaultConfig().

*To configure Svea authorization:*
Create a class (eg. one for testing values, one for production) that implements the IConfigurationProvider Interface. Let the implemented methods
return the authorization values asked for.
Later when starting a WebpayConnection action in your integration file, put an instance of your class as parameter to the constructor.

*NOTE:* This solution may change in future updates!

Step 1:

```csharp

using Webpay.Integration.CSharp.Config;
using Webpay.Integration.CSharp.Util.Constant;

namespace SveaWebpayIntegration
{
    public class MyConfigTest : IConfigurationProvider
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Get the return value from your database or likewise
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="type"> eg. HOSTED, INVOICE or PAYMENTPLAN</param>
        /// <param name="country">country code</param>
        /// <returns>user name string</returns>
        public string GetUsername(PaymentType type, CountryCode country)
        {
            return myUserName;
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Get the return value from your database or likewise
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="type"> eg. HOSTED, INVOICE or PAYMENTPLAN</param>
        /// <param name="country">country code</param>
        /// <returns>password string</returns>
        public string GetPassword(PaymentType type, CountryCode country)
        {
            return myPassword;
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Get the return value from your database or likewise
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="type"> eg. HOSTED, INVOICE or PAYMENTPLAN</param>
        /// <param name="country">country code</param>
        /// <returns>client number int</returns>
        public int GetClientNumber(PaymentType type, CountryCode country)
        {
            return myClientNumber;
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Get the return value from your database or likewise
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="type"> eg. HOSTED, INVOICE or PAYMENTPLAN</param>
        /// <param name="country">country code</param>
        /// <returns>merchant id string</returns>
        public string GetMerchantId(PaymentType type, CountryCode country)
        {
            return myMerchantId;
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Get the return value from your database or likewise
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="type"> eg. HOSTED, INVOICE or PAYMENTPLAN</param>
        /// <param name="country">country code</param>
        /// <returns>secret word string</returns>
        public string GetSecretWord(PaymentType type, CountryCode country)
        {
            return mySecretWord;
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Constants for the end point url found in the class SveaConfig
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="type"> eg. HOSTED, INVOICE or PAYMENTPLAN</param>
        /// <returns>end point url</returns>
        public string GetEndPoint(PaymentType type)
        {
            return type == PaymentType.HOSTED ? SveaConfig.GetTestPayPageUrl() : SveaConfig.GetTestWebserviceUrl();
        }
    }
}

```

Step 2: Put an instance of your configuration object as a parameter to the request.

```csharp
		//Create a class including test authorization
		MyConfigTest confTest = new MyConfigTest();
		//Create a class including production authorization
		MyConfigProd confProd = new MyConfigProd();

		//Create your CreateOrder object with selected and continue building your order. Se next steps.
		private CreateOrderEuResponse response = WebpayConnection.CreateOrder(confTest);
	.....

```

## 3. Building an order
We show how to specify an order, working through the various steps and options along the way:
Start by creating an order using the WebpayConnection.CreateOrder() method. Pass in your configuration and get an instance of CreateOrderBuilder in return.

```csharp
CreateOrderEuResponse response = WebpayConnection.CreateOrder(myConfig)

```

### 3.1 Specify order
Continue by adding values for products and other. You can add order row, fee and discount. Chose the right Item object as parameter.
You can use the *add* functions with an Item object or a List of Item objects as parameters. See types of Item objects in examples in 4.1.2 - 4.1.5 and 4.3.1 - 4.3.2.

```csharp
.AddOrderRow(Item.OrderRow(). ...)

//or

var orderRows = new List<OrderRowBuilder>();
orderRows.Add(Item.OrderRow(). ...)
...
CreateOrder.AddOrderRows(orderRows);
```
For every new payment type implementation, you follow the steps from the beginning and chose your payment type preferred in the end:
Build order -> choose payment type -> DoRequest/GetPaymentForm/PreparePayment

```csharp
CreateOrderEuResponse response = WebpayConnection.CreateOrder(myConfig)		//See Configuration chapt.3
//For all products and other items
.AddOrderRow(Item.OrderRow()...)
//If shipping fee
.AddFee(Item.ShippingFee()...)
//If invoice with invoice fee
.AddFee(Item.InvoiceFee()...)
//If discount or coupon with fixed amount
.AddDiscount(Item.FixedDiscount()...)
//If discount or coupon with percent discount
.AddDiscount(Item.RelativeDiscount()...)
//Individual customer values
.AddCustomerDetails(Item.IndividualCustomer()...)
//Company customer values
.AddCustomerDetails(Item.CompanyCustomer()...)
//Other values
.SetCountryCode(CountryCode.SE)
.SetOrderDate(new DateTime(2012, 12, 12))
.SetCustomerReference("ref33")
.SetClientOrderNumber("33")
.SetCurrency(Currency.SEK)

//Continue by choosing one of the following paths
//Continue as a card payment
.UsePayPageCardOnly()
	...
	.GetPaymentForm();
    or
    .PreparePayment("234.214.2.23")
    or
    .PrepareMailPayment()
//Continue as a direct bank payment
.UsePayPageDirectBankOnly()
	...
	.GetPaymentForm();
    or
    .PreparePayment("234.214.2.23")
    or
    .PrepareMailPayment()
//Continue as a PayPage payment
.UsePayPage()
	...
	.GetPaymentForm();
    or
    .PreparePayment("234.214.2.23")
    or
    .PrepareMailPayment()
//Continue as a PayPage payment
.UsePaymentMethod(PaymentMethod.DBSEBSE) //see APPENDIX for Constants
	...
	.GetPaymentForm()
    or
    .PreparePayment("234.214.2.23")
    or
    .PrepareMailPayment()
//Continue as an invoice payment
.UseInvoicePayment()
	...
	.DoRequest();
//Continue as a payment plan payment
.UsePaymentPlanPayment("campaigncode", false)
	...
	.DoRequest();
```

If you want to prepare a payment or an email payment and send a link to the user for the payment. In this case a hosted payment will be used.
The `.PreparePayment()`-method and `.PrepareMailPayment()`-method will return a `Uri` for the customer to use to complete the payment of the order.

### 3.2 Customer Identity
Customer identity is required for invoice and payment plan orders. Required values varies
depending on country and customer type. For SE, NO, DK and FI national id number is required. Email and ip address are desirable.

#### 3.2.1 Options for individual customers
```csharp
.AddCustomerDetails(Item.IndividualCustomer()
    .SetNationalIdNumber("194605092222")	//Required for individual customers in SE, NO, DK and FI
    .SetBirthDate("19460509")        		//Required for individual customers in NL and DE
    .SetName("Tess", "Testson")        		//Required for individual customers in NL and DE
    .SetInitials("SB")                 		//Required for individual customers in NL
    .SetStreetAddress("Gatan", "23")     		//Required in NL and DE
    .SetCoAddress("c/o Eriksson")      		//Optional
    .SetZipCode("9999")                  		//Required in NL and DE
    .SetLocality("Stan")               		//Required in NL and DE
    .SetPhoneNumber("999999"))           	//Optional
    .SetEmail("test@svea.com")         		//Optional but desirable
    .SetIpAddress("123.123.123")       		//Optional but desirable
```

#### 3.2.2 Options for company customers
```csharp
.AddCustomerDetails(Item.CompanyCustomer()
    .SetNationalIdNumber("2345234")			//Required for company customers in SE, NO, DK, FI
    .SetVatNumber("NL2345234")				//Required for NL and DE
    .SetCompanyName("TestCompagniet")) 		//Required for Eu countries like NL and DE
	.SetAddressSelector("7fd7768")          //Optional. Recieved from getAddresses
```

### 3.3 Other values
```csharp
.SetCountryCode(CountryCode.SE)         	//Required
.SetCurrency(Currency.SEK)                     	//Required for card payment, direct payment and PayPage payment.
.SetClientOrderNumber("33")           		//Required for card payment, direct payment, Unique String(65). Optional for Invoice and Payment plan String(32).
.SetOrderDate(new DateTime(2012, 12, 12))       //Required for synchronous payments
.SetCustomerReference("ref33")             	//Optional for invoice and payment plan String(32), ignored for card & direct bank orders.
```

### 3.4 Choose payment
End process by choosing the payment method you desire.

Invoice and payment plan will perform a synchronous payment and return an object as response.

Other payments(card, direct bank and payments from the *PayPage*) on the other hand are asynchronous. They will return an html form with formatted message to send from your store.

The response is then returned to the return url you have specified in function *SetReturnUrl()*. The response may also be sent to the url specified with *SetCallbackUrl()* in case the customer doesn't return to the store after the transaction has concluded at the bank/card payment page.

If you pass the xml response to an instance of SveaResponse, you will receive a formatted response object as well.

#### Which payment method to choose?
*I am using the invoice and/or payment plan payment methods in my integration.*

>The best way is to use `.UseInvoicePayment()` and `.UsePaymentPlanPayment()`. These payment methods are synchronous and will give you an instant response.

*I am using the card and/or direct bank payment methods in my integration.*

>The best way if you know what specific payment you want to use, is to go direct to that specific payment, bypassing the PayPage step, by using
`.UsePaymentMethod()`. See APPENDIX for Constants
>
>You can also use the PayPage with `.UsePayPageCardOnly()` and `.UsePayPageDirectBankOnly()`.

*I am using all payment methods in my integration, and wish to let the customer select which to use.*

>The most effective way is to use `.UseInvoicePayment()` and `.UsePaymentPlanPayment()` for the synchronous payments, and use the `.UsePaymentMethod()` for the asynchronous requests.
>
>Alternatively you can go by *PayPage* for the asynchronous requests by using `.UsePayPageCardOnly()` and `.UsePayPageDirectBankOnly()`.

*I wish to prepare an order and receive a link that I can email to a customer, who then will complete the order payment. Using either prepared payment (url is valid up to one hour) or prepared email payment.*

>Create and build the order, then select the payment method with the *.UsePaymentMethod()*, but instead of getting a form for sending the customer to Webpay through HTTP POST with *.GetPaymentForm()*, use *.PreparePayment()* or *.PrepareMailPayment()* to get an prepared url to send to the customer to WebPay through a HTTP GET.

*I am using more than one payment and want them gathered on on place.*

>You can go by *PayPage* and choose to show all your payments here, or modify to exclude or include one or more payments. Use `.UsePayPage()` where you can custom your own *PayPage*. This introduces an additional step in the customer checkout flow, though. Note also that Invoice and Payment plan payments will return an asynchronous when used from PayPage.


## 4. Payment method reference
Select payment method to use with the CreateOrderBuilder class useXX() methods, which return an instance of the appropriate payment request class.

### 4.1 Invoice Payment
Perform an invoice payment. This payment form will perform a synchronous payment and return a response.
Returns *CreateOrderEuResponse* object. Set your store authorization here.


```csharp
CreateOrderEuResponse response = WebpayConnection.CreateOrder()
.AddOrderRow(...)                           // required, one or more
.AddCustomerDetails(...)                    // required, individualCustomer or companyCustomer
.SetCountryCode(CountryCode.SE)             // required
.SetOrderDate(new DateTime(2012, 12, 12))   // required

.UseInvoicePayment()                         // requires the above attributes in the order
	.DoRequest();
```

### 4.2 PaymentPlan Payment
Perform *PaymentPlanPayment*. This payment form will perform a synchronous payment and return a response.
Returns a *CreateOrderEuResponse* object. Preceded by WebPay.GetPaymentPlanParams(...).
Set your store authorization here.
Param: Campaign code recieved from GetPaymentPlanParams().

```csharp
CreateOrderEuResponse response = WebpayConnection.CreateOrder()
.AddOrderRow(...)                           // required, one or more
.AddCustomerDetails(...)                    // required, individualCustomer or companyCustomer
.SetCountryCode(CountryCode.SE)             // required
.SetOrderDate(new DateTime(2012, 12, 12))   // required

.UsePaymentPlanPayment(1234L, false)              	//Parameter1: campaign code recieved from getPaymentPlanParams
							//Paremeter2: True if Automatic autogiro form will be sent with the first notification
   .DoRequest();
```
[<< To top](https://github.com/sveawebpay/dotnet-integration/tree/master#cnet-integration-package-api-for-sveawebpay)

### 4.3 Card payment
Select i.e.
.UsePaymentMethod(PaymentMethod.SVEACARDPAY) //see APPENDIX for Constants
to perform a card payment via the SveaCardPay card payment provider.

```csharp
PaymentForm form = WebpayConnection.CreateOrder()
.AddOrderRow(...)                       //required
.SetCountryCode(CountryCode.SE)         // required
.SetClientOrderNumber("33")
.SetOrderDate(new DateTime(2012, 12, 12))
.UsePaymentMethod(PaymentMethod.SVEACARDPAY)
	.SetReturnUrl("http://myurl.se")                   	//Required
	.SetCallbackUrl("http://myurl.se")                   	//Optional
	.SetCancelUrl("http://myurl.se")                   	//Optional
            .GetPaymentForm();

```
.SetReturnUrl() When a hosted payment transaction completes (regardless of outcome, i.e. accepted or denied), the payment service will answer with a response xml message sent to the return url specified.

.SetCallbackUrl() In case the hosted payment transaction completes, but the service is unable to return a response to the return url, the payment service will retry several times using the callback url as a fallback, if specified. This may happen if i.e. the user closes the browser before the payment service redirects back to the shop.

.SetCancelUrl() In case the hosted payment service is cancelled by the user, the payment service will redirect back to the cancel url. Unless a return url is specified, no cancel button will be presented at the payment service.

### 4.3.1 Recurring card payment

A recurring card payment uses the same logic as a normal card payment except that you need to a subscriptionType using .SetSubscriptionType()

```csharp
PaymentForm form = WebpayConnection.CreateOrder()
.AddOrderRow(...)  
.SetCountryCode(CountryCode.SE)      
.SetClientOrderNumber("33")
.SetCurrency("SEK)
.SetOrderDate(new DateTime(2016, 12, 24))
.UsePaymentMethod(PaymentMethod.SVEACARDPAY)
.SetSubscriptionType(subscriptionType)
	.SetReturnUrl("http://myurl.se")
            .GetPaymentForm();

```

There are four different subscription types:

```csharp
RECURRING*
RECURRINGCAPTURE
ONECLICK*
ONECLICKCAPTURE
```
Subscription types marked with a * is only possible to use if the merchant has a scandinavian acquirer.

RECURRING and RECURRINGCAPTURE should be used if no action is required by the card holder, for example if the customer should be charged every month.

ONECLICK and ONECLICKCAPTURE should be used if the card holder is required to make an action each time the card should be charged such as refilling a virtual coin pouch used in games or other services.

RECURRINGCAPTURE and ONECLICKCAPTURE should be used if the merchant wants to capture the initial transaction which results in money being charged.

RECURRING and ONECLICK should be used if you dont want to capture the initial transaction, in this case the money is reserved for a few days and then will be returned unless a "recur" is made(explained below).

After using the method above you will get a subscriptionId in you response which you will use in order to make recur calls.

Subscriptions can be automaticlly charged, log in to the payment gateway to configure this otherwise use the method below to charge the card manually.

A subscription is valid for 12 months and after that you will need to renew the subscription.

### 4.3.2 Recur
By sending in the customerReference, subscriptionId, currency and amount you will successfully charge money from a existing subscription.
```csharp
var hostedActionRequest = new HostedAdmin(SveaConfig.GetDefaultConfig(), CountryCode.SE)
                .Recur(new Recur(
                    customerRefNo: 10000001,
                    subscriptionId: 123123123,
                    currency: "SEK",
                    amount: 10000
                ));
HostedAdminRequest hostedAdminRequest = hostedActionRequest.PrepareRequest();	
var hostedAdminResponse = hostedActionRequest.DoRequest<HostedAdminResponse>();
```
If the call was successful a transaction is made in the payment gateway.

### 4.3.3 Cancelling a subscription
To cancel a subscription you need to call .cancelRecurSubscription() with the subscriptionId.
```csharp
var hostedActionRequest = new HostedAdmin(SveaConfig.GetDefaultConfig(), CountryCode.SE)
                .CancelRecurSubscription(new CancelRecurSubscription(
                    subscriptionId: "12341234"
                ));

            var hostedAdminRequest = hostedActionRequest.PrepareRequest();
	    var hostedAdminResponse = hostedActionRequest.DoRequest<HostedAdminResponse>();
```
The payment gateway will respond with statuscode 0 indicating a success.

### 4.4 Direct bank payment

Select i.e.
.UsePaymentMethod(PaymentMethod.NORDEASE) //see APPENDIX for Constants
to perform a bank payment redirected direct to the selected bank landing page.

```csharp
PaymentForm form = WebpayConnection.CreateOrder()
.AddOrderRow(...)                       //required
.SetCountryCode(CountryCode.SE)         // required
.SetClientOrderNumber("33")
.SetOrderDate(new DateTime(2012, 12, 12))
.UsePaymentMethod(PaymentMethod.NORDEASE)
	.SetReturnUrl("http://myurl.se")                   	//Required
	.SetCallbackUrl("http://myurl.se")                   	//Optional
	.SetCancelUrl("http://myurl.se")                   	//Optional

```

.SetReturnUrl() When a hosted payment transaction completes (regardless of outcome, i.e. accepted or denied), the payment service will answer with a response xml message sent to the return url specified.

.SetCallbackUrl() In case the hosted payment transaction completes, but the service is unable to return a response to the return url, the payment service will retry several times using the callback url as a fallback, if specified. This may happen if i.e. the user closes the browser before the payment service redirects back to the shop.

.SetCancelUrl() In case the hosted payment service is cancelled by the user, the payment service will redirect back to the cancel url. Unless a return url is specified, no cancel button will be presented at the payment service.


### 4.5 PayPage
*PayPage* with all available payments. You can also custom the *PayPage* by using one of the methods for *PayPagePayments*:
SetPaymentMethod, IncludePaymentMethod, ExcludeCardPaymentMethod or ExcludeDirectPaymentMethod.

```csharp

## 6.1 WebpayConnection.CreateOrder()

Use WebpayConnection.CreateOrder() to create an order using invoice, payment plan, card, or direct bank payment methods.

See the CreateOrderBuilder class for more info on methods used to specify the order builder contents
and chosing a payment method to use, followed by sending the request to Svea and parsing the response.

See the CreateOrderBuilder class for more info on methods used to specify the order builder contents
and chosing a payment method to use, followed by sending the request to Svea and parsing the response.

Invoice and Payment plan orders will perform a synchronous payment on doRequest(), and will return a response
object immediately.

Card, Direct bank, and other hosted methods accessed via PayPage are asynchronous. They provide an html form
containing a formatted message to send to Svea, which in turn will send a request response to a given return url,
where the response can be parsed using the SveaResponse class.

```csharp
CreateOrderEuResponse response = WebpayConnection.CreateOrder(myConfig)		//See Configuration chapt.3
//For all products and other items
.AddOrderRow(Item.OrderRow()...)
//If shipping fee
.AddFee(Item.ShippingFee()...)
//If invoice with invoice fee
.AddFee(Item.InvoiceFee()...)
//If discount or coupon with fixed amount
.AddDiscount(Item.FixedDiscount()...)
//If discount or coupon with percent discount
.AddDiscount(Item.RelativeDiscount()...)
//Individual customer values
.AddCustomerDetails(Item.IndividualCustomer()...)
//Company customer values
.AddCustomerDetails(Item.CompanyCustomer()...)
//Other values
.SetCountryCode(CountryCode.SE)
.SetOrderDate(new DateTime(2012, 12, 12))
.SetCustomerReference("ref33")
.SetClientOrderNumber("33")
.SetCurrency(Currency.SEK)

```

## 6.5 WebpayConnection.DeliverOrder()
Use the WebpayConnection.DeliverOrder request to deliver one Invoice order with specified orderrows and/or one complete payementplan order.
Use the WebpayConnection.DeliverOrder request to confirm one Card order.
You can use this function to credit an invoice order, but it is recomended to use WebpayConnection.CreditOrderrows() instead.
You can use this function to partly deliver an invoice order, but it is recomended to use WebpayConnection.DeliverOrderRows() instead.
If you want to deliver a complete order, or orders, it is recomended to use WebpayConnection.DeliverOrders() instead.

Paymentplan orders can not be partly delivered, and there fore no orderrows is required.

Returns *DeliverOrderEuResponse* object.

For invoice orders, the specified rows will automatically be matched with the rows that was sent when creating the order.

If an item is left out from the DeliverOrder request that was present in the CreateOrder request, a new invoice will be created as the order is assumed to be partially fulfilled.
Any left out items should not be delivered physically, as they will not be invoiced when the DeliverOrder request is sent.

```csharp
	DeliverOrderBuilder request = WebpayConnection.DeliverOrder(config)
		.SetOrderId()                  // invoice or payment plan only, required
		.SetCountryCode()              // required
		.SetInvoiceDistributionType()  // invoice only, required
        .SetNumberOfCreditDays()       // invoice only, optional
        .AddOrderRow()                 // Required for invoice payments
        .SetCreditInvoice()            // invoice only. optional
         ;
        // then select the corresponding request class and send request
     response = request.DeliverInvoiceOrder().doRequest();       // returns DeliverOrderResponse
     response = request.DeliverPaymentPlanOrder().doRequest();   // returns DeliverOrderResponse
	 response = request.DeliverCardOrder().doRequest();   // Confirms a card order and returns ConfirmResponse


```

You can add OrderRow, Fee and Discount. Choose the right Item as parameter.
You can use the **.Add** functions with an Item or list of Items as parameters.

```csharp
.AddOrderRow(Item.OrderRow(). ...)

//or

List<OrderRowBuilder> orderRows = new List<OrderRowBuilder>(); //or use another preferrable List object
orderRows.Add(Item.OrderRow(). ...)
...
DeliverOrder.AddOrderRows(orderRows);
```

## 6.6. CloseOrder
Use when you want to cancel an undelivered order. Valid only for invoice and payment plan orders.
Required is the order id received when creating the order. Set your store authorization here.

#### Close by payment type
```csharp
    .CloseInvoiceOrder()
or
    .ClosePaymentPlanOrder()
```

```csharp
CloseOrderEuResponse response =  WebpayConnection.CloseOrder()
	.SetOrderId(orderId)						//Required, received when creating an order.
	.SetCountryCode(CountryCode.SE)			//Required
	.CloseInvoiceOrder()
	.DoRequest();
```
[<< To top](https://github.com/sveawebpay/dotnet-integration/tree/master#cnet-integration-package-api-for-sveawebpay)

## 7. Response handler
All synchronous responses are handled through *SveaResponse* and structured into objects.
Asynchronous responses recieved after sending the values *merchantid* and *xmlMessageBase64* to
hosted solutions can also be processed through the *SveaResponse* class.

The response from server will be sent to the *returnUrl* with POST or GET. The response contains the parameters:
*response*, *merchantid* and *mac*.
Class *SveaResponse* will return an object structured similar to the synchronous answer.

It's highly recommended to validate the mac parameter that is contained in the response, which is done by processing the correct variables through the *SveaResponse* class.

Params:
responseXmlBase64 - The POST or GET message Base64 encoded
macToValidate - Mac provided in the POST or GET message
countryCode - Your countryCode(i.e SE)
SveaConfig - SveaConfig object containing merchantid and secret word
```csharp
	var respObject = new SveaResponse(responseXmlBase64, macToValidate, countryCode, SveaConfig);
```

If the mac is invalid the decoded xml will contain an ErrorMessage saying "Mac validation failed." and if the validation is successful the ResultCode will be "0 (ORDER_ACCEPTED)".

If you dont want to validate the mac simply see the example below.

Params:
* The POST or GET message Base64 encoded
```csharp
	var respObject = new SveaResponse(responseXmlBase64);
```

## 8. WebpayAdmin entrypoint method reference
The WebpayAdmin class methods contains the functions needed to handle orders for Webservice payments as well as hosted payments.
It contains entrypoint methods used to define order contents, send order requests, as well as various support methods needed to do this.

### 8.1 WebpayAdmin.QueryOrder
The WebpayAdmin.QueryOrder entrypoint method is used to get information about an order.

```csharp
  QueryOrderBuilder request = WebpayAdmin.QueryOrder(config)
        .SetOrderId()                 // required
        .SetTransactionId()           // optional, card or direct bank only, alias for SetOrderId
        .SetCountryCode()             // required
        ;
        // then select the corresponding request class and send request
        response = request.QueryInvoiceOrder().DoRequest();         // returns AdminWS.GetOrdersResponse
        response = request.QueryPaymentPlanOrder().DoRequest();     // returns AdminWS.GetOrdersResponse
        response = request.QueryCardOrder().DoRequest();            // returns Hosted.Admin.Actions.QueryResponse
        response = request.QueryDirectBankOrder().DoRequest();      // returns Hosted.Admin.Actions.QueryResponse

```

[<< To top](https://github.com/sveawebpay/dotnet-integration/tree/master#cnet-integration-package-api-for-sveawebpay)

### 8.2 WebpayAdmin.DeliverOrderRows
The WebpayAdmin.DeliverOrderRows entrypoint method is used to deliver individual order rows. Supports invoice and card orders.

For Invoice orders, the order row status is updated at Svea following each successful request.

For card orders, an order can only be delivered once, and any non-delivered order rows will be cancelled (i.e. the order amount will be lowered by the sum of the non-delivered order rows). A delivered card order has status CONFIRMED at Svea.

Get an order builder instance using the WebpayAdmin.DeliverOrderRows() entrypoint, then provide more information about the transaction and send the request using the DeliverOrderRowsBuilder methods:

Use SetRowToDeliver() or SetRowsToDeliver() to specify the order row(s) to deliver. The order row indexes should correspond to those returned by i.e. WebpayAdmin.QueryOrder();

For card orders, use AddNumberedOrderRow() or AddNumberedOrderRows() to pass in a copy of the original order rows. The original order rows can be retrieved using WebpayAdmin.QueryOrder; the numberedOrderRows attribute contains the serverside order rows w/indexes. Note that if a card order has been modified (i.e. rows cancelled or credited) after the initial order creation, the returned order rows will not be accurate.


```csharp
  DeliverOrderRowsBuilder request = WebpayAdmin.DeliverOrderRows(config)
        .SetOrderId()                 // required
        .SetTransactionId()           // optional, card or direct bank only, alias for SetOrderId
        .SetCountryCode()             // required
        .SetInvoiceDistributionType() // required for invoice only
        .SetRowToDeliver()            // required, index of original order rows you wish to deliver
        .AddNumberedOrderRow()        // required for card orders, should match original row indexes
        ;
        // then select the corresponding request class and send request
        response = request.DeliverInvoiceOrderRows().DoRequest();   // returns AdminWS.DeliverOrderRowsResponse
        response = request.DeliverCardOrder().DoRequest();          // returns Hosted.Admin.Actions.ConfirmResponse


```

### 8.3 WebpayAdmin.DeliverOrders
        Use WebpayAdmin.DeliverOrders to deliver one or more orders of the same type without specifying order rows.
        All order rows as currently held by Svea will be delivered when the request is made.

        When delivered, invoice orders will return a corresponding invoice id, and payment plan orders a contract number.
        These may be found in the returned DeliverOrderResult structure along with the corresponding order id.
```csharp
   DeliverOrdersBuilder request = WebpayAdmin.DeliverOrders(config)
        .SetOrderId()                 // optional, order id to deliver
        .SetOrderIds()                // optional, note that order ids must all be of the same type (invoice, part payment)
        .SetCountryCode()             // required
        .SetInvoiceDistributionType() // required for invoice only, will apply to all invoice orders
        ;
        // then select the corresponding request class and send request
        response = request.DeliverInvoiceOrders().DoRequest();     // returns AdminWS.DeliveryResponse
        response = request.DeliverPaymentPlanOrders().DoRequest();  // returns AdminWS.DeliveryResponse

```

        .SetOrderId()                 // required, use SveaOrderId recieved with createOrder response
        .SetTransactionId()           // optional, card or direct bank only, alias for SetOrderId
        .SetCountryCode()             // required
        ;
        // then select the corresponding request class and send request
        response = request.CancelInvoiceOrder().DoRequest();       // returns AdminWS.CancelOrderResponse
        response = request.CancelPaymentPlanOrder().DoRequest();   // returns AdminWS.CancelOrderResponse
        response = request.CancelCardOrder().DoRequest();          // returns Hosted.Admin.Actions.AnnulResponse
